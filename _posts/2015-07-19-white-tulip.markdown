Today, I finished watching the TV show [Fringe](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1119644/). It's a show about mad scientists, responsibility, parallel dimensions, love, and many other things. I'll leave the synopsis to IMDB and Wikipedia. I have watched many tv shows these past few years, but Fringe, [Dollhouse](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1135300/), and [The West Wing](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0200276) are my favorites. If you haven't seen them, I would highly recommend it. Fringe's presentation of the competing forces of intelligence and emotion is flawless. In the final episode, one character has the line: 

*"... the heights of his intellect and ... the depths of his emotion ..."*

The phrase itself carries connotations of opposites. We often talk about feelings being passionate, fiery, irrational, or unpredictable. Meanwhile, thoughts are tranquil, cool, stoic, or logical. Furthermore, in this day and age, we attribute logic to being superior to emotion. Even, the word "heights" has associations with higher, better things, while "depths" is lower, darker, or worse. Society teaches us to think about the next logical move or to be calculating with our plans. Gut feelings discounted and instincts ignored. Science tries to rationalize the decline of emotion. Psychology and neuroscience tells us that our limbic system, which controls emotions and our primal urges, is animalistic. The evolution of the prefrontal cortex, which controls complex cognitive behavior, helps us override the limbic system and make decisions. Anthropology tells us that applying rules and regulations assisted humans in developing functional societies. However, in my opinion, thoughts and feelings are two sides of the same coin. Both are necessary to process information from our surroundings. Although we may choose one over the other at times, neither is always superior.

Even so, this balancing of thoughts and feelings is something I continue to struggle with. One example is if you ask some of my friends, they may half-jokingly say that *"I don't take other people's feelings into account".* The idea being that I do whatever I want, regardless of the consequences on other people. I have since self-revised the phrase to, *"the better I know you, the less I take your feelings into account".* Most people think this is absurd, which is understandable. Shouldn't you care more about how your friends feel? They are your friends after all. For me, the thought process is one of self-advocacy. An example might make more sense. In a restaurant, I try to be kinder and more courteous to the wait staff. They are people I will likely meet just once, and I would like to leave them with a good impression [#peakendrule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak–end_rule). Their job is to serve the customer and even if the customer does something that makes them feel uncomfortable, fear of job loss may prevent them from speaking out about their personal feelings. My hope is to make their job easier and spread a little good will in the world.

On the other hand, the expectation for my friends is that we know each other well enough to push boundaries (*"Only those that risk going too far can possibly know how far they can go."*), and we trust each other to self-advocate for our own needs and wants. Perhaps most importantly, at the end of the day, the hope is that we will be closer friends for communicating how we feel. It is said that bonds are formed through collective hardship. I may not like it, but I try to welcome critique and constructive criticism because that's how I can improve myself. Where it becomes tricky is when people's needs conflict with each other. That is something I am still trying to figure out. Does prioritizing my own needs make me selfish and uncaring? If I am distraught, how can I care for others?

Another example is that I process emotions differently from other people. The most prevalent is that I don't find any point in being sad or angry (a point of contention amongst my friends). It could be a result of years of education in school and in society has ingrained the superiority of rational thought. Emotions cloud thought. Emotions distract from the mission. It's a popular [theme](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/RomanticismVersusEnlightenment) and has even been [caricturized](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/FreudianTrio) in all sorts of stories. My apathy towards "negative" emotions could also be because of the quote, *“for every minute you are upset, you lose sixty seconds of happiness”*. Being happy is enjoyable and thus acceptable.

The argument that is made for the worth of the other emotions is usually along the lines of one of the following:

* You can't have highs without lows.
* You can't control how you feel. Emotions happen to you.
* There is worth in the experience of feeling these other emotions. For example, feeling angry can drive you to correct a wrong. The ability to feel sad allows you to empathize.

I agree with these points, but I also think they are incomplete. I like to experience new things, but if something makes me feel bad, why put myself through that again? Perhaps I can't control how I feel about situations, but each of us has the power to control how we react with our emotions. Marianne Williamson once said, *"Our deepest fear is not that we are inadequate. Our deepest fear is that we are powerful beyond measure. It is our light, not our darkness that most frightens us."* Instead of lashing out in anger or shutting down in depression, I believe it is possible to channel these feelings into something productive or a deeper understanding of ourselves. Pixar's [Inside Out](http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2096673/) does a phenomenal job of showing the interplay of emotions. Nostalgia or melancholy is a combination of Joy and Sadness.

I am fortunate to have never been truly depressed. It has been described to me as a feeling of hopelessness, of powerlessness, of losing faith in the world, of being unable to forgive themselves. The depths of this feeling is something I can barely begin to imagine. So please forgive me if I cannot completely empathize, but I do try to the best of my abilities. All I can leave you with is that there is hope out there and that one way or another, [IGBOK](http://igbok.com).
