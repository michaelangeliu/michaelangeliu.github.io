RecApp is a project I worked on at GROUP360 WorldWide. It was started before I arrived as an internal event tracking application for the G360 experiential team. The original ask was fairly straight-forward:

* Users could sign-in and view a list of events
* Users could add a new event through a form
* Users could view the information from a single event
* Users could edit the information on a single event

Over time, as the app was tested and used, the scope has changed. Features have been added, updated, or removed. 

* Events are nested under Programs which are nested under Brands
* New form fields were added to allow more data to be included
* Users have different permissions and content access levels
* User role types have increased to allow for content approvers and client viewers
* Event photo uploading was added
* Photos can be filtered by tags or events
* Photos can be reordered in how they are displayed
* Photos can be favorited to be shown in the PDF report
* Weather was added and removed
* PDF report generation was added
* Comments can be added and favorited
* Data can be aggregated on the program level to show statistics of the included events
* Giveaways can be created and added to events

Working on this project was incredibly helpful for learning some of the intricacies of the Ruby language and the Rails framework.
